<p> Some defendants are so mentally ill as to lack all understanding of their crime and its consequences and may be 
considered mentally incompetent. Such individuals may be unfit to stand trial or be found not guilty by reason of insanity. 
If they are convicted and become incompetent while on death row, they cannot be executed, under earlier Supreme Court 
precedent. However, most people with mental illness — including many with severe mental illness — are not mentally 
incompetent.</p>

<br><p> Tennessee executed David Earl Miller (pictured at age 24) in the state’s electric chair on December 6, 2018, 
after Governor Bill Haslam denied his application for clemency and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to address the denials 
history of mental illness who experienced extensive sexual and physical abuse as a child, opted to be executed by electric
chair after the Tennessee Supreme Court denied other prisoners’ challenges to a three-drug lethal-injection process that
 Miller and his lawyers believed would result in an extended torturous death. </p>

<p> A total of 273 people were executed during the study period, 268 of which were male. A total of 147 executed inmates 
were white, 90 were black, 35 were Latino, and one was Native American. The majority of the executed inmates (205) had an
 instant offense of homicide only, followed by homicide plus rape, homicide plus robbery, homicide plus rape plus kidnapping, 
 and mass murder or serial killing. The vast majority of the inmates (270) were executed by lethal injection; two were
 executed with electrocution and one via a firing squad. In terms of a psychiatric record, the researchers found that 26%
 of those executed had a history of mental illness and/or were treated with psychotropic medication. However, that
 information wasn't available on the Death Penalty Information Center site and was difficult to find, Riess told MedPage 
 Today. Most of the prisoners (117) had been on Death Row for 11-20 years, with the next biggest group (64) having spent 
 21-30 years on Death Row, and 15 prisoners having spent 31-40 years. Only five prisoners had been on Death Row for 
 ≤5 years. </p>
