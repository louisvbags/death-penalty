<p> This boy by the name of George Stinnley Jr was the youngest person in American history to be executed. He did nothing 
wrong. He was wrongfully murdered for a crime he did not commit and the people of North Carolina knew that. He was convicted
 for the murders of two little girls and was sentences to the electric chair. His family could not see his execution because
 the people of the small town threatened them if they did not leave town. It took the jury ten minutes to convict this 14, 
 90 pound boy of a murder. It also turned out that one of the jurors knew who was the killer this entire time and allowed 
 this boy to get killed. George's attorney was no help either. On the day of his execution, he was too short to reach the 
 electric chair so the guards made him sit on a bible. Again, he was only 14 years old. </p>

<p> Fewer than 40% of Georgia homicide cases involve white victims, but in 87% of the cases in which a death sentence is 
imposed the victim is white. White-victim cases are roughly eleven times more likely than black-victim cases to result in 
a sentence of death. </p>
