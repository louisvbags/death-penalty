<p> An update of a study by the ACLU of Northern California on the costs of the death penalty found additional expenses 
due to a net increase in the size of death row. The analysis found, “The 11 new additions to death row add almost $1 
million to the annual cost of housing people on death row, now totaling $61.2 million more each year than the cost of
 housing in the general population. … The recently approved state budget also includes $136 million in funds to begin
 construction of a new death row facility, a project that will cost more than $400 million to complete.” The state has been
 facing the largest deficit of any state in the country and has had to cut numerous other programs.</p>

<p>It costs more to house death penalty prisoners, as well. In Kansas, housing prisoners on death row costs more than 
twice as much per year ($49,380) as for prisoners in the general population ($24,690). In California, incarceration
 costs for death penalty prisoners totaled more than $1 billion from 1978 to 2011 (total costs outside of incarceration
 were another $3 billion). By the numbers, the annual cost of the death penalty in the state of California is $137 million 
 compared to the cost of lifetime incarceration of $11.5 million. </p>
